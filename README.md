# ESPHome - Audio Media Player
**Install Version: ESPHome-2024.12.4, Core: 2025.2.0
* https://github.com/rwrozelle/core, specifically homeassistant/components/esphome/media_player.py.
* https://github.com/rwrozelle/esphome, the components api and media_player.
* https://github.com/rwrozelle/aioesphomeapi

This external component provides an audio media-player with the following HA Available services:
* turn_on - sends action on_turn_on
* turn_off - sends action on_turn_off
* toggle, 
* volume_up
* volume_down
* volume_set
* volume_mute
* media_play
* media_pause
* media_stop
* media_next_track
* media_previous_track
* clear_playlist
* shuffle_set
* repeat_set
* play_media - can turn an m3u file into a playlist
** enqueue - add, next, play, replace
** announce - after announcement is played, the current track is restarted
* join - members of group are will turn off, turn on, set volume, and play the same media as leader. Synchronization is attempted by telling leader and group members to start media at the same time. Uses the Time component in the sntp platform to assume that chips have the same time.
* unjoin

Audio Media Component uses [Espressif Audio Development Framework (ADF)](https://github.com/espressif/esp-adf) version 2.6 and only works using the esp-idf version: 4.4.8

## External Component - audio-media-player
The esp-adf code is based on https://github.com/gnumpi/esphome_audio. Code is simplified to concentrate on above capabilities with the following components, note:  Only tested using this hardware:

1. ESP32-S3-DevKit1
2. I2S PCM5102 DAC Decoder

This component is built to solve the following use case:  Be able to play an extensive library of flac and mp3 files available in a local web server using ESPHome and standard HA functionality. I have python code that will generate m3u files from my library and I've made these files visible in Media Sources.

![image info](./images/media-source.PNG)

The code uses esp_decoder and is configured for the following:

* DEFAULT_ESP_AMRNB_DECODER_CONFIG(),
* DEFAULT_ESP_AMRWB_DECODER_CONFIG(),
* DEFAULT_ESP_FLAC_DECODER_CONFIG(),
* DEFAULT_ESP_OGG_DECODER_CONFIG(),
* DEFAULT_ESP_OPUS_DECODER_CONFIG(),
* DEFAULT_ESP_MP3_DECODER_CONFIG(),
* DEFAULT_ESP_WAV_DECODER_CONFIG(),
* DEFAULT_ESP_AAC_DECODER_CONFIG(),
* DEFAULT_ESP_M4A_DECODER_CONFIG(),
* DEFAULT_ESP_TS_DECODER_CONFIG(),

I've only used it with flac and mp3 files. Flac files play correct "most" of the time, a little chattering every now and then. I've written a Python script to use ffmpeg to convert flac files to mp3(320Kb) and found the sound comparible with less to no chattering.  I'm not an audio-file, I just built this to be able to reuse old stereo equipment that I own and learn about esphome.

## Internet Radio m3u file
Only a small portion of internet radio stations play correctly, here is an example of a working station:
```
#EXTM3U
#EXTINF:0,Jazz Groove - East
http://east-mp3-128.streamthejazzgroove.com/stream
```

## Play Media Enqueue
* replace - stops current track, clears playlist and plays provided file. If file is not an m3u, player creates a single track playlist.
* add - adds file to end of running playlist, if file is an m3u, then adds each track to the playlist.
* next - adds file to front of running playlist
* play - adds file to end of playlist and restarts.

## Announcements
Announcements are added to a separate "announcements" playlist and current playlist is stopped and all added announcements are played, then current track is restarted.

## Join / Unjoin
There is commented code which is an attempt to synchronize sound accross the group members leveraging multicast. I never could get it to work right. Instead, code attempts to get group members to start each track at the same time as the leader.

Best used when speakers are not in earshot of each other since small variation in play timing is inevitable with this approach.
I've noticed some chatter that I think is caused by my Media Server being overwhelmed by multiple requests of same file.  This may be an incorrect thought.

The knowledge of the group members does not survive a reboot. Here is an example script to set the group members:
```
alias: Media Player 1 Join
sequence:
  - service: media_player.join
    metadata: {}
    data:
      group_members:
        - media_player.media_player_2
    target:
      entity_id: media_player.media_player_1
mode: single
description: ""
```

# Installation
This is how I install, there are other approaches:

1. Clone the following repositories.  For example, I've cloned them to C:\github
```
* C:\github\aioesphomeapi is a clone of https://github.com/rwrozelle/aioesphomeapi
* C:\github\audio-media-player is a clone of https://github.com/rwrozelle/audio-media-player
* C:\github\core is a clone of https://github.com/rwrozelle/core
* C:\github\esphome is a clone of https://github.com/rwrozelle/esphome
```

2. Use Samba share (https://github.com/home-assistant/addons/tree/master/samba) to create a mapped drive (Z:) to the Home Assistant __config__ folder

3. Copy C:\github\aioesphomeapi\aioesphomeapi to Z:\
![image info](./images/aioesphomeapi.PNG)

4. If needed, create Z:\custom_components
5. Copy C:\github\core\homeassistant\components\esphome to Z:\custom_components
![image info](./images/external_components_esphome.PNG)

6. Modify Z:\custom_components\esphome\manifest.json and add:
  ,"version": "1.0.0"
![image info](./images/esphome_manifest.PNG)

7. If needed, create Z:\esphome\components
8. Copy C:\github\audio-media-player\esphome\components\audio_media_player to Z:\esphome\components
9. Copy C:\github\esphome\esphome\components\api to Z:\esphome\components
10. Copy C:\github\esphome\esphome\components\media_player to Z:\esphome\components
![image info](./images/esphome_components.PNG)
11. Restart HA, In the raw log file will be the entry:
```
WARNING (SyncWorker_0) [homeassistant.loader] We found a custom integration esphome which has not been tested by Home Assistant. This component might cause stability problems, be sure to disable it if you experience issues with Home Assistant
```
This means that HA is using code in Z:\custom_components\esphome, not the code that comes with HA Release.

Build your ESPHome device using the Example Yaml as a guide.
